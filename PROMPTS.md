# Prompts

1. add the apache 2.0 license file

2. refactor main into separate concerns – each in a separate file.
   main should import all and orchestrate them.

3. before doing anything, print the statistics about the data: image sizes
   and other attributes, how many classes are there and how many samples of
   each class, is the dataset balanced?
