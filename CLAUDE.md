# Guide

1. Use the uv virtual environment for managing packages and running the project.
2. Include a requirements.txt file for imported packages.
3. When writing code:
   - Follow clean code and SOLID principles. 
   - Keep the code simple and readable.
   - Make the code self-explanatory using clear names.
     Avoid using comments, when possible.
   - Don't mix and match different levels of abstraction.
     Each function should stick to a single level of abstraction, delegating to sub-functions, if necessary.
   - The code should be efficient. For example, try to cache the results of repeated queries that don't change often.
4. Do not commit code. Only modify files and let me do the committing.
5. Record any prompt I type in PROMPTS.md file at the root of the project.
